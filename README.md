K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-Python This repository contains projects related to KNN algorithm using Python.  Introduction: K Nearest Neighbors - Classification K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique.
